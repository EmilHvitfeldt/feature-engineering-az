## Stop words
:::

The term **stop words** is a very loaded term, that is often under-explained and therefore misunderstood by practitioners. The original definition is a set of words that contains no information and are safe to remove. This is too simplistic of a view. Instead, we can think of words as having an amount of signal in them related to the task we are trying to accomplish. Removing low-signal words can be fruitful, if we are able to identify them.
