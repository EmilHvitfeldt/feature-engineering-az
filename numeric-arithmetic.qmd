## Arithmetic
:::

With domain knowledge, we can generate quite good features by combining multiple existing numeric variables. This chapter is less about methods, but rather exploring and reinforcing the idea that powerful transformations can happen when you apply simple arithmetic operators carefully and thoughtfully.

An important kind of transformation we can get with arithmetic operators is *ratios*. Simply dividing two columns by each other can give us better insights than what we could get without.

```{r}
#| label: fig-numeric-ratios
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| fig-cap: |
#|   Some relationships can be detangled using ratios.
#| fig-alt: |
#|   2 scatter charts. The left chart has points evenly scattered along the x (deposits) and y (withdrawals) axis. A color scale is used to indicate the outcome variable, which appears to have high values when deposits are high and withdrawals are low. The right chart shows the ratio of these two variables plotted along the x-axis and the outcome plotted along the y-axis. They appear to follow each other linearly with some noise.
set.seed(1234)
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)

ratio_data <- tibble(
  deposits = rpois(500, 120),
  withdrawals = rpois(500, 110)
) |>
  mutate(outcome = deposits / withdrawals + rnorm(500, sd = 0.1)) 

g1 <- ratio_data |>
  ggplot(aes(deposits, withdrawals, color = outcome)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "top")

g2 <- ratio_data |>
  mutate(ratio = deposits / withdrawals) |>
  ggplot(aes(ratio, outcome)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal()

g1 + g2
```
