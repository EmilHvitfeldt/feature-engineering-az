# Overview {#sec-categorical}

One of the most common types of data you can encounter is categorical variables. These variables take non-numeric values and are things like `names`, `animal`, `housetype` `zipcode`, `mood`, and so on. We call these *qualitative* variables and you will have to find a way to deal with them as they are plentiful in most data sets you will encounter. You will, however, unlike numerical variables in @sec-numeric, have to transform these variables into numeric variables as most models only work with numeric variables. The main exception to this is tree-based models such as decision trees, random forests, and boosted trees. This is of cause a theoretical fact, as some implementations of tree-based models don't support categorical variables.

The above description is a small but useful simplification. A categorical variable can take a known or an unknown number of unique values. `day_of_the_week` and `zipcode` are examples of variables with a fixed known number of values. Even if our data only contains Sundays, Mondays, and Thursdays we know that there are 7 different possible options. On the other hand, there are plenty of categorical variables where the levels are realistically unknown, such as `company_name`, `street_name`, and `food_item`. This distinction matters as it can be used to inform the pre-processing that will be done.
