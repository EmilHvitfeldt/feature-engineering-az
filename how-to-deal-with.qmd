# How to Deal With ... {.unnumbered}

This book is structured according to the types of data and problems you will encounter. Each section specifies a type of data or problem, and each chapter details a method or group of methods that can be useful in dealing with that type. So for example @sec-numeric contains methods that deal with numeric variables such as @sec-numeric-logarithms and @sec-numeric-maxabs, and @sec-categorical contains methods that deal with categorical variables such as @sec-categorical-dummy and @sec-categorical-hashing. There should be sections and chapters for most methods you will find in practice that isn't too domain-specific.

It is because of this structure that this book is most suited as reference material, each time you encounter some data you are unsure how to deal with, you find the corresponding section and study the methods listed to see which would be best for your use case. This isn't to say that you can't read this book from end to end. In fact, the sections have been ordered roughly such that earlier chapters are broadly useful and later chapters touch on less used data types and problems.

## Terminology {#sec-terminology}

Below are some terms we use throughout the book, that we want to make sure are clear. Some of these might differ from other books, and that is fine. This is why we have this section. Some of the methods described in this book are known under multiple names. When that is the case, it will be listed at the beginning of the chapter. The index will like wise point you to the right chapter regardless of which name you use.

### Observations

This books will mostly be working with rectangular data. In this context, each *observation* is defined as a row, with the columns holding the specific characteristics for each observation.

The observational unit can change depending on the data. If we were looking at a data set of restaurant health code inspections, you are likely to see the data with one row per inspection. However, depending on your problem statement or hypothesis, you might want to think of each restaurant as a observation. If you are thinking from a planning perspective you could think of each day/week as an observation.

Reading this book will not tell you how to think of your data as we don't know what you are trying to do. Once you have your data in the right format and order, we can show you what is possible.

### Learned

Some methods requires information to be transformed, that we are not able to supply beforehand. In the case of centering of numeric variables described in @sec-numeric-normalization. To be able to do this transformation, you need to know the mean value of the training data set. This mean is the sufficient information needed to perform the calculations, and is the reason why the method is a *learned* method.

On the other hand, taking the square root of a variable as described in @sec-numeric-sqrt isn't a learned method as there isn't any sufficient information needed. The method can be applied right away.

### Supervised / Unsupervised

Some method use the outcome to guide the calculations. If the outcome is used, the method is said to be *supervised*. Most methods are unsupervised.

### Levels

Variables that contain non-numeric information are typically called qualitative or categorical variables. This can be things such as eye color, street names, names, grades, car model and subscription types. Where there is finite known set of values a categorical variable can take, we call these values the *levels* of that variables. So the levels of the variables containing weekdays are "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", and "Sunday". But the names of our subscribers doesn't have levels as we don't know all of them.

We will sometimes bend this definition, as it is sometimes useful to pretend that a variable has a finite known set of values, even if it doesn't.

### Linear models

We talk about *linear models* as models that are specified as a linear combination of features. These models tend to simple, and fast to use, but having the limitation of "linear combination of features" means that struggle if the data has non-linear effects.
