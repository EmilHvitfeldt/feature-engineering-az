# Overview {#sec-time-series}

A very common type of data is **time-series data**. This is data where the observations is taken across time with time stamps. This data will inherently be correlated with with itself as the same measurement for the same unit likely isn't going to change too much. Time series data is typically modeling using different methods than for other predictive modeling for this reason.

Nevertheless there are still some methods that will provide useful for us. It is important to note that there is a time component to this data, which is what we are trying to predict. The observations can happen at regular intervals, once a day, or irregular intervals, each time the engine errors. Different types of data uses different types of models, and makes the feature engineering a little different depending on what you are trying to do.

This chapter assumes the user knows how to use time series data and the precoutions that are need when working with data of this type.

One area of work is modifying the sequence itself. Some of these transformations can be taken from @sec-numeric. But there are some metrics that are specific to time series data. Likewise some metrics ar similar to what we do in @sec-missing and @sec-outliers, but special care needs to be taken with time series data.

@sec-time-series-smooth
@sec-time-series-sliding
@sec-time-series-log-interval
@sec-time-series-missing
@sec-time-series-outliers


Another area of methods is where we extract or modify the sequence or its data to create new variables, this is done with taking the time component into consideration.

@sec-time-diff
@sec-datetime
