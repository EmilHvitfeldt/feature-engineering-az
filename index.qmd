# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to "Feature Engineering A-Z"! This book is written to be used as a reference guide to the different techniques. This is reflected in the chapter structure. Any question a practitioner is having should be answered by looking at the index and finding the right chapter.

Each section tries to be as comprehensive as possible with the number of different methods/solutions that are presented. A section on dimensionality reduction should list all the practical methods that could be used, as well as a comparison between the methods to help the reader decide what would be most appropriate.

Whenever possible each method will be accompanied by simple mathematical formulas and visualizations to illustrate the mechanics of the method.

Lastly, each section will include code snippets in showcasing how to implement the methods. Preferable in R and Python, Keras/PyTorch. This book is a methods book first, a coding book second.
