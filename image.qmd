# Overview {#sec-image}

Image data is quite dissimilar to anything we have seen so far in this book. And will be need a whole different set of techniques to deal with them. For Most of this book, the unit of data was 1 value, such as 4, 7, or 0.3562 for numeric, and "cat" and "dog" for categorical. Text data as seen in @sec-text, is being treated as a series of tokens.

Image data on the other hand is represented as an array of numbers, typically integers with varying dimensions. Each image is comprised of pixels, these pixels are laid out in a rectangular grid. For each pixel value you typically have between 1 and 4 values. These are called channels. 1 channel is used for gray-scale images. 3 channels are used for color images as they have a red channel, green channel and blue channel. Lastly sometimes there are also a forth channel for opacity.

This means that for a 500 pixel by 1000 pixel color image, we have `500 * 1000 * 3 = 1500000` values. This is quite a lot of data, and hopefully we will be able to squeeze some out if it.

The preprocessing techniques for images can be split into a couple of categories. All of which will be covered.

## Feature Extraction

- Edge detection
- corner detection
- texture analysis

## Image Modification

- Grayscale conversion
- color modifications (includes brightness and contrast)
- noise reduction
- Value normalization
- resizing

## Augmentation

To create a larger data set, with the hopes of increasing the performance and generalization

- Changing brightness
- Shifting, Flipping, Rotation
- Cropping, Scaling

## Embeddings

- ImageNet
- resNet
