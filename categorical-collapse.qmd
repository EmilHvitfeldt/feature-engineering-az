# Collapsing Categories {#sec-categorical-collapse}

There are times, especially when you have a lot of levels in a categorical variable, that it will be beneficial for you to combine some of them. This practice is in some ways similar to what we saw in @sec-categorical-cleaning, but here we are doing it for performance reasons.

Essentially what we are working on, is trying to combine many levels to get higher performance and interpretability

this has two prongs

- these levels are similar due to expert knowledge
- there aren't enough observations here, let us combine them
