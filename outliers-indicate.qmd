A nondestructive way of handling outliers is to not remove or impute them,
but to add indicators that they are there.
This is similar in style to how we do [missing value indicators](missing-indicator.qmd) but without the need to modify the outlier values themselves.

The method works by identifying the predictor values that are outliers,
then creating indicator variables denoting whether that predictor has an outlier or not.
