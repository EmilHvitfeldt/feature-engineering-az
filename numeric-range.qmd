# Range {#sec-normalization}

**Range scaling** is a method where to make the data fit into a pre-defined interval. Also called **Min-Max scaling**. Typically the equation used to illustrate this method is show like so

$$
X_{scaled} = \dfrac{X - \text{min}(X)}{\text{max}(X) - \text{min}(X)}
$$

However, this equations only shows what happens if you use the software with defaults.

(show equation with custom ranges)

(show equation with clipping)

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

### Cons

## R Examples

`step_range()` clips. Does allow user to specify range `step_minmax()` doesn't clip. doens't allow user to specify range

## Python Examples

`MinMaxScaler()` doesn't clip by default. Allows user to specify range.
