## Identify
:::

Identifying outliers is a very big topic and could be a whole book by itself.
This chapter will contain the briefest overview,
and it encouraged that you read up more about outliers before you do anything about them.

To identify outliers we need to think about how outliers come into existance.
In this book we will vastly oversimplify things and state that there are 2 major types of outliers,
**meassurement outliers** and **natural outliers**.
This binary split happens to align neatly with our advice of how you should treat outliers.

To understand **measssurement outliers** we need to remind ourselves that data really is.
It is a digital representation of something real.
Some phisical attribute, a signal, a relationship, a location.
Meassurement outliers happen when there is a mismatch between the real value and the recorded value.
This could be an OCR error, 
cat walking across the keyboard doing data entry,
or the wrong observation being included in the data base query.
All of these outliers should either be fixed or be treated as missing values.
Because we know that they are not the real value there is no information to be gained from it.
We need to remember that outlier-ness can be happening on a specific value or on a whole observation.

1 value vs 1 observation

should focus about on fixing the data over omitting the data

should be dealt with by talking to people

natural outliers

should avoid touching at all cost
as it changes the domain we are modeling
think about using specific methods or models. WITH CARE
